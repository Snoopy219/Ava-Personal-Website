    Hello! My name is Ava! I am a junior in high school. I am a member of my school’s Drug Free, Robotics, and Girls Who Code clubs as well as my school's National Honor Society Chapter. I play the flute in my school's band. I am also a Girl Scout and have completed my Bronze and Silver Award. I am a member of my school’s cross country and track team where I compete in the hurdles and high jump events. I have three dogs, a cat, and a rabbit that are so cute. My dogs’ names are Bo, Stella, and Snoopy. My cat’s name is Scummy and my rabbit’s name is Sugar. I have participated in many coding camps, and also taken courses at my school.
